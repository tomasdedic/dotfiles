"    #SourceFolder:  # Optional  # The source folder that the copy pattern(s) will be run from.  Empty is the root of the repo.  Use [variables](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=550988) if files are not in the repo. Example: $(agent.builddirectory)",
"    Contents: ${1:**}  # Required  # File paths to include as part of the copy. Supports multiple lines of match patterns. [More Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=708389)",
"    TargetFolder: $2  # Required  # Target folder or UNC path files will copy to. You can use [variables](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=550988). Example: $(build.artifactstagingdirectory)",
"    #CleanTargetFolder:  # Optional  # Delete all existing files in target folder before copy",
"    #OverWrite:  # Optional  # Replace existing file in target folder",
"    #flattenFolders:  # Optional  # Flatten the folder structure and copy all files into the specified target folder.",
"    #preserveTimestamp:  # Optional  # Using the original source file, preserve the target file timestamp.",
"    #retryCount:  # Optional  # Specify the retry count to copy the file. It might help to resolve intermittent issues e.g. with UNC target paths on a remote host.",
"    #delayBetweenRetries:  # Optional  # Specify the delay between two retries. It might help to be more resilient to intermittent issues e.g. with UNC target paths on a remote host.",
"    #ignoreMakeDirErrors:  # Optional  # Ignore errors which happen during creation of target folder. This could be useful to avoid issues with parallel execution of task by several agents with one target folder.",
