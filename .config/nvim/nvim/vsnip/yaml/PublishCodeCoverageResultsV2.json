For e.g., JaCoCo reports do not use absolute paths and when publishing JaCoCo coverage for Java apps, the pattern would be similar to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/src/main/java/`.<br />This input is also needed if tests are run in a docker container. This input should point to absolute path to source files on the host. For e.g., `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/`",
