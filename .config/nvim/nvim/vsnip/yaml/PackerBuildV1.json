"- task: PackerBuild@1",
"  inputs:",
"    templateType: ${1:builtin} # Options: 'builtin', 'custom' # Required  # Select whether you want the task to auto generate Packer template or use custom template provided by you.",
"    customTemplateLocation: $2  # Required when templateType = custom  # Path to a custom user-provided template.",
"    #customTemplateParameters:  # Optional  # Specify parameters which will be passed to Packer for building custom template. This should map to \"variables\" section in your custom template. E.g. if the template has a variable named \"drop-location\", then add a parameter here with name \"drop-location\" and a value which you want to use. You can link the value to a release variable as well. To view/edit the additional parameters in a grid, click on \"…\" next to text box.",
"    ConnectedServiceName: $3  # Required  # Select the Azure Resource Manager subscription for baking and storing the machine image.",
"    isManagedImage: ${4:true}  # Required  # Check if generated image should be a managed image.",
"    managedImageName: $5  # Required when isManagedImage = true  # The Name of the Managed disk image for Auto Generated Templates.",
"    location: $6  # Required  # Location for storing the built machine image. This location will also be used to create a temporary VM for the purpose of building image.",
"    storageAccountName: $7  # Required  # Storage account for storing the built machine image. This storage account must be pre-existing in the location selected.",
"    azureResourceGroup: $8  # Required  # Azure Resource group that contains the selected storage account.",
"    baseImageSource: ${9:default} # Options: 'default', 'customVhd' # Required  # Select the source of base image. You can either choose from a curated gallery of OS images or provide URL of your custom VHD image. <br/>Please note that if you have selected option to create a Managed image by checking 'Managed VM disk image' option, then you should only choose 'Gallery' option here. 'Custom' source is not supported to create a managed image.",
"    baseImage: ${10:MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2012-R2-Datacenter:windows} # Options: 'MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2012-R2-Datacenter:windows', 'MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2016-Datacenter:windows', 'MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2012-Datacenter:windows', 'MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2008-R2-SP1:windows', 'Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.4-LTS:linux', 'Canonical:UbuntuServer:16.04-LTS:linux', 'Canonical:UbuntuServer:18.04-LTS:linux', 'RedHat:RHEL:7.2:linux', 'RedHat:RHEL:6.8:linux', 'OpenLogic:CentOS:7.2:linux', 'OpenLogic:CentOS:6.8:linux', 'credativ:Debian:8:linux', 'credativ:Debian:7:linux', 'SUSE:openSUSE-Leap:42.2:linux', 'SUSE:SLES:12-SP2:linux', 'SUSE:SLES:11-SP4:linux' # Required  # Choose from curated list of OS images.

"    customImageOSType: ${12:windows} # Options: 'windows', 'linux' # Required ",
"    packagePath: $13  # Required  # Specify the path for deployment package directory relative to $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory). Supports minimatch pattern. Example path: FrontendWebApp/**/GalleryApp <br/> Please note that this package will be copied to temporary virtual machine which Packer creates. If the package contains large number of files and/or the files are very large in size, the upload can take quite long time (possibly running into few hours). To optimize the upload time, please see if size of the package can be meaningfully reduced. Another alternative is to use an intermediary Azure storage account. Upload the package to a storage account prior to running this task. And for this task, use a package containing a script which will download the required package from the storage account.",
"    deployScriptPath: $14  # Required  # Specify the relative path to powershell script(for Windows) or shell script(for Linux) which deploys the package. This script should be contained in the package path selected above. Supports minimatch pattern. Example path: deploy/**/scripts/windows/deploy.ps1",
"    #deployScriptArguments:  # Optional  # Specify the arguments to be passed to deployment script.",
"    #additionalBuilderParameters:  # Optional  # In auto generated Packer template mode the task creates a Packer template with an Azure builder. This builder is used to generate a machine image. You can add keys to the Azure builder to customize the generated Packer template. For example setting ssh_tty=true in case you are using a CentOS base image and you need to have a tty to run sudo.<br/>To view/edit the additional parameters in a grid, click on “…” next to text box.",
"    #skipTempFileCleanupDuringVMDeprovision:  # Optional  # During deprovisioning of VM, skip clean-up of temporary files uploaded to VM. Refer [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/azure.html#skip_clean)",
"    #packerVersion:  # Optional  # Specify the version of Packer to install. This will work only with custom templates.",
"    #imageUri:  # Optional  # Provide a name for the output variable which will store generated machine image VHD url for un-managed VM image or image name for managed VM image.",
"    #imageId:  # Optional  # Provide a name for the output variable which will store the azure resource id for the newly created image.  This is for managed images only.",
