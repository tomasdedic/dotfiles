"    codeCoverageTool: ${1:JaCoCo} # Options: 'Cobertura', 'JaCoCo' # Required  # The tool with which code coverage results are generated.",
"    summaryFileLocation: $2  # Required  # Path of the summary file containing code coverage statistics, such as line, method, and class coverage. The value may contain minimatch patterns. For example: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/**/site/cobertura/coverage.xml`",
"    #pathToSources:  # Optional  # Path to source files is required when coverage XML reports do not contain absolute path to source files. For e.g., JaCoCo reports do not use absolute paths and when publishing JaCoCo coverage for Java apps, the pattern would be similar to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/src/main/java/`.<br />This input is also needed if tests are run in a docker container. This input should point to absolute path to source files on the host. For e.g., `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/`",
"    #reportDirectory:  # Optional  # Path of the code coverage HTML report directory. The report directory is published for later viewing as an artifact of the build. The value may contain minimatch patterns. For example: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/**/site/cobertura`",
"    #additionalCodeCoverageFiles:  # Optional  # File path pattern specifying any additional code coverage files to be published as artifacts of the build. The value may contain minimatch patterns. For example: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*.exec`",
