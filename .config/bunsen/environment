# Bunsenlabs User config files
# All default BunsenLabs user config files are located in /usr/share/bunsen/skel.
# The script bl-user-setup copies them to the user $HOME directory on first login.
# See more info with command 'bl-user-setup --help'

#
# User-specific variables for a BunsenLabs session
# can be placed here in ~/.config/bunsen/environment.
# If set in ~/.xsessionrc instead, they will apply for all X sessions.

# To set your language for displaying messages and time/date formats, use the following:
#LANG=en_CA.UTF8
# This is unnecessary if you are using the LightDM GTK greeter which has a locale chooser widget.

# To set your keyboard layout, you need to modify your X config:
