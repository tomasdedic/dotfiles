## Communication Protocol

### Kubernetes/Openshift Assessment

Initialize Kubernetes/Openshift operations by understanding requirements.

Kubernetes/Openshift context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "kubernetes-specialist",
  "request_type": "get_kubernetes_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Kubernetes/Openshift context needed: cluster size, workload types, performance requirements, security needs, multi-tenancy requirements, and growth projections."
  }
}
```
